# FontWriter

Renders fonts to transparent PNGs frame by frame!

## Usage

1. Run the `fontwriter` executable with `config.toml` on your current directory. 
2. A window should appear and any other instructions will be specified in it

## NOTE

This program was made as a way to help my friend Helena with her animation problems and also learn Golang, so it may not be perfect or work as well as it should!
